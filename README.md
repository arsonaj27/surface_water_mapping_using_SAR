# Time Series Analysis of Surface Water Using SAR Images 

Surface water bodies play vital role in supporting the ecosystem services in various countries around the world, mainly related to domestic, industrial, and agricultural uses, such as food, electricity (hydropower), medicinal substances and other materials production from biota, and the creation of recreation zones. Monitoring surface water is essential for both ecological and hydrological studies. The Kulekhani Reservoir in Nepal, the country’s only operational storage-based hydropower facility, holds significant importance in this context. However, conventional monitoring methods that rely on costly sensors and ground-based systems present substantial economic challenges for developing nations like Nepal. It is one and only operational storage-based hydropower present in Nepal. In this study, we present a cost-effective approach for surface water mapping and time series analysis using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite imagery. The generated time series provides continuous records of water extent over time, enabling the detection of seasonal and interannual variations in the reservoir. Such temporal insights are invaluable for optimizing hydropower operations, assessing drought or flood impacts, forecasting water availability, and supporting long-term water resource planning. This approach demonstrates how remote sensing can enhance sustainable reservoir management by providing reliable, repeatable, and data-driven insights for decision-makers.
